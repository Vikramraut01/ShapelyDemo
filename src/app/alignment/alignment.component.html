        <h1>Page Image Alignment</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and
          flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them
          snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose
          from the options of None, Left, Right, and Center. In addition, they
          also get the options of Thumbnail, Medium, Large & Fullsize.

        />
        <p>The image above happens to be centered.</p>
      </div>

          />

          The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text
          wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned. As you can see
          the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.
          The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not
          right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words.
          Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one
          more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of
          the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting
          the do it’s thang. Mission accomplished!
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="noalign">
        <p>And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.</p>
        <img
          src="https://149842022.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        <p>
          The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content
          area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the
          flow of content.
        </p>
        <div id="hanging">
          <img
            src="https://149842022.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg"
          />
          <p>
            And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there
            should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image.
            Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I
            don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t
            let anyone else tell you differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the
            right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be
            plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just
            like that. It never felt so good to be right.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <br />
        And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over
        again with captions!

            <p>Look at 580×300 getting some caption love.</p>

      <p>
        The image above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in
        it, just to see if it does anything funky.
